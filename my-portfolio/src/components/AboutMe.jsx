              Hi, I am Ahsan, a passionate Front-End Developer based in Rangpur, Bangladesh.

                <p>
                  My journey in programming started in 2022 when I first encountered HTML and CSS. I was captivated by how
                  websites come to life with just a few lines of code. From there, I moved on to learning JavaScript, which
                  opened up a whole new world of dynamic, interactive web development. Over time, I dived into React, Tailwind CSS,
                  and other modern front-end tools, which I now use to build responsive, user-friendly web applications.
                  My passion for coding continues to grow as I solve new challenges and build meaningful projects.

                <h2 className="font-semibold text-primary text-center">The Type of Work I Enjoy:</h2>
                <p>
                  I thrive on building clean, efficient, and visually appealing websites. Whether it is creating interactive
                  components with React, styling websites using Tailwind CSS, or ensuring a smooth user experience, I enjoy every
                  step of the development process. My goal is always to create websites that are not only functional but also
                  enjoyable to use. I love turning ideas into reality and collaborating with others to bring their visions to life.

                <h2 className="font-semibold text-primary text-center">Hobbies and Interests Outside Programming:</h2>
                <p>
                  When I am not coding, I enjoy spending time outdoors. I am a huge fan of sports like cricket and football, where
                  I can engage in friendly competition and stay active. Additionally, I have always had a passion for photography,
                  capturing moments and exploring the beauty in everyday life. I also enjoy reading, particularly books on personal
                  development and technology. These activities help me relax, unwind, and stay inspired to bring fresh ideas to my
                  work.

                <p>
                  I am a detail-oriented and driven individual who thrives in collaborative environments. I value continuous
                  learning and always strive to improve my skills. I enjoy problem-solving, which is why I find programming so
                  fulfilling. I am also a good listener and enjoy connecting with others who share similar interests. Whether it is
                  working on a team project or sharing knowledge with fellow developers, I believe that great things come from
                  collaboration.
